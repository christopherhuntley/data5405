Work together and ask lots of questions. If you don't finish tonight then continue to collaborate as a study project for Quiz 5.** \n","\n","Quiz 5 is more like a final exam. You will be assigned two programming problems to complete **on your own**. That means no help from your classmates, roommates, family members, etc. There will be some very strict rules about this. To be sure it is your work, you will have to walk through the code afterwards to explain what each line does and why it has to be the way you coded it ... It's really hard to fake that.  \n","\n","The following problem was on last year's quiz but has since been retired. Good luck!\n","\n","### Problem\n","Write a function `all_combinations()` that generates every subset (combination) of $r$ numbers from a sequence $0, ... , n-1$. For full credit, use a generator that yields each combination as a list. Otherwise, return a list of combinations as nested lists. \n","\n","### Notes\n","- There are ${n \\choose r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ possible combinations.\n","- The numbers within each subset $a, b, c, ...$ are always increasing with $a < b < c < ...$\n","- We can represent this as a matrix with ${n \\choose r}$ rows (one per combination ) and $r$ columns (one per choice).\n","- The maximum number in each column $i$ is $n-r+i$. A column at the upper end of the range is _**maxed out**_.\n","- For example, with $n=7$ and $r=5$, the combinations are \n","```python\n","[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], # subsequences are always increasing\n","   [0, 1, 2, 3, 5],\n","   [0, 1, 2, 3, 6], # maximum of column 4 is 7-5+4 = 6\n","   [0, 1, 2, 4, 5],\n","   [0, 1, 2, 4, 6],\n","   [0, 1, 2, 5, 6], # maximum of column 3 is 7-5+3 = 5\n","   [0, 1, 3, 4, 5],\n","   [0, 1, 3, 4, 6],\n","   [0, 1, 3, 5, 6],\n","   [0, 1, 4, 5, 6], # maximum of column 2 is 7-5+2 = 4\n","   [0, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n","   [0, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n","   [0, 2, 3, 5, 6],\n","   [0, 2, 4, 5, 6],\n","   [0, 3, 4, 5, 6], # maximum of column 1 is 7-5+1 = 3\n","   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n","   [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n","   [1, 2, 3, 5, 6],\n","   [1, 2, 4, 5, 6],\n","   [1, 3, 4, 5, 6],\n","   [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]  # maximum of column 0 is 7-5+0 = 2\n"," ```\n","\n","### General Algorithm\n","\n","Treat this as a constrained counting problem, with each matrix row representing a number with $k$ digits. Starting in the first row with each column at its lowest possible value (i.e., [0,1, ..., $r$-2, $r$-1]) we iterate through the possible combinations one at a time, stopping in the last row with every column maxed out (i.e., [$n-r$, $n-r+1$, ..., $n$-2, $n$-1]). In each iteration, we _**increment**_ the numbers in the preceeding row as follows:\n","- Select the right-most column that is not maxed out. Mark it as the _**increment column**_.\n","- Add 1 to the selected _increment column_.\n","- All columns to the _right_ of the _increment column_ are _**reset**_ to count upwards from the current value of the increment column.
