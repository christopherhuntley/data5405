# Welcome to Fairfield Dolan on **Slack**

We will be using Slack as our primary means of communication. Slack is a great instant messaging and discussion tool that is widely used in the corporate world, particularly in tech firms, analytics shops, and startups, so it will be useful for you to be familiar with it in any case. It allows threaded discussions, private group discussions, private direct messages (DM's), and voice and video calls. Our Slack workspace will also have other useful information for you, including possible internships, interesting roundtable discussions, and other invitations and perks.

To join Slack, go to https://fairfield-dolan.slack.com/ and login with your @student.fairfield.edu account. You will probably want to download both the desktop and mobile apps so you can participate in the course wherever you are. Once you are on Slack itself, go through their [walkthrough](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members) and [tutorial](https://slack.com/resources/slack-101/what-is-slack) if it's your first time.

When you're ready, you may need to be added to the course channel for this course. The initial course roster will already be pre-loaded, so if you were on that, you should be able to already see the #buan5405 channel. Go there for more info and next steps. If you do not see that channel, please send a direct message on Slack to @Yue Pu telling her that you need to be added to the `#buan5405` channel.

Some basic Slack etiquette:
1.  Whenever possible, try to respond within a thread, or if it is a top-level message, start a new thread to respond (it's the little cartoon speech bubble looking icon between the add-emoji and share-message buttons).
2.  Rather than DM'ing instructors and other students, try to keep most messages within the course channel so that we all benefit from the common discussion.
3.  Change your notification settings to match what you prefer, but do try to check in on Slack frequently. Asynchronous communication is fine, but one of the fun parts of Slack is you might engage with others about an interesting topic at a weird time of day or night, just because you all happen to be on at the same time.
4.  Be respectful. It's surprisingly easy to misinterpret someone's typed words. Assume good intent from others and have good intent yourself.
5.  Try to stay on topic for each channel. There is also a #random channel for memes and gifs and jokes and whatnot.
6.  Update your profile to include some basic information about yourself, and a photo would be nice.
7.  When in doubt, it's usually better to participate than to not. If someone asks a question you think you may know an answer to, or a way of thinking about it, that is extraordinarily helpful.
8.  Use emojis liberally, especially to applaud or congratulate or thank someone.

See you on Slack!
