When done submit to Google Classroom as usual. \n","- Only submit programs for the problems that have been assigned to you. No credit will be given for problems not assigned to you. \n","- All code must be your own. Do not consult with others except at the explicit direction of the instructor. You may consult with the instructor but don't expect anyone to do the work for you. \n","- You may not import any modules except as directed. \n","- You may consult your textbook, the Colab lessons, and Python.org. You may also use StackExchange to aid your debugging. ALL OTHER SOURCES ARE OFF LIMITS unless linked in the challenge itself. \n","- Professionalism counts. For each problem make your work literate by:\n","  - *Commenting your code to make it easy to follow.* Top comments are used to describe logical blocks of code. Side comments are used to provide implementation details. And, of course, line length and indentation matter. Top comments line up with code blocks (and _almost never_ with the left margin). Side comments never extend the line beyond 80 characters. Generally, top comments are preferred for complex logic. \n","  - *Using Markdown to provide context for your code.* Make it easy for us to grade and perhaps give out partial credit. What problem are you addressing (use the names here)? What were the requirements (in your own words)? What approach did you take? If you just type out a big wall of unformatted text with occasional bold text then you will lose _all_ professionalism points for the problem.

There was no concept of digits or place values. This of course made everyday calculations a bit more complicated than we think of them today.\n","\n","Write a function `egyptian_multiply()` that \n","- accepts as input two integers $x$ and $y$ (e.g., 25 and 7)  \n","- calculates the product using ancient Egyptian arithmetic (see General Algorithm below)\n","- returns a string formatted like \"25 x 7 = 112 + 56 + 7 = 175\".\n","\n","### General Algorithm\n","In ancient Egypt, without even a basic numbering system, there was no way to express the times tables like every school child learns today. Even if there were, they would not have the place-value system needed to multiply numbers with 2 or more digits. Instead, Egyptian multiplication relied on basic sums like 3 x 2 = 2 + 2 + 2. This worked fine for small products but could be very tedious and error-prone for larger products like 1259 x 258, which could take days to add 258 to itself 1258 times.  So, they came up with an ingenious shortcut that saved lots of time and error. \n","\n","The procedure worked something like this:\n","1. Assume that we are multiplying two numbers $x$ and $y$. \n","2. Make a list of the powers of 2 (1,2,4,8,...), where each term is the sum of the previous term with itself (1, 1+1=2, 2+2=4, 4+4=8), stopping when the last number is at least as big as $x$. Call this list `powers_of_two`. \n","3. Perform the same process as step 2 but with the first nunber being $y$ instead of $1$ (i.e., $y$, $y+y$, $y+y+y+y$, etc.) stopping when the list is the same length as `powers_of_two`. Let's call this second list `multiples_of_y`.\n","4. Find the set of terms in `powers_of _two` that sum to exactly $x$. \n","5. The product is then the sum of the terms in `multiples_of_y` that correspond to the terms we found in step 4. \n","\n","Here, for example, is how to calculate 22 x 7:\n","1. $x$ = `22` and $y$ = `7`\n","2. `powers_of_two` = `[1,2,4,8,16,32]`\n","3. `multiples_of_y` = `[7,14,28,56,112,224]`\n","4. `2+4+16=22`\n","5. `14+28+112=154`\n","\n","The final output would be `\"22 x 7 = 14 + 28 + 112 = 154\"`. \n","\n","### Tips\n","\n","- [Egyptian multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication) is very similar to so-called Russian Peasant multiplication. You may find the Russian Peasant version slightly easier to understand. \n","- You *can* generate `powers_of_two` with a list comprehension but it may be easier to do it with a while loop. To be most efficient, it may make sense to generate `multiples_of_y` in the same loop. \n","- Step 4 is a variation of the [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem). You are trying to find the largest subset of the items (numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...) that will fit (sum) inside the knapsack ($x$). The trick with most knapsack problems is to take a so-called \"greedy\" approach, where we try inserting items from biggest to smallest; with each item we insert, we have to adjust the remaining space in the knapsack to account. The logic is something like this:\n","    1. Sort the items from largest to smallest. \n","    2. Insert the biggest item that will fit into the knapsack. \n","    3. Account for the space remaining the knapsack after intersion. \n","    4. Repeat 2 & 3 until the knapsack is filled. \n","\n","  In this case, you can exactly fill the knapsack with a single pass through the items. In other words, you only need to try each item once *as long as you start with the biggest ones first*. \n","\n","  Note: it hard to get more specific than that without writing code. \n","\n","- To be sure the output string is formatted consistently consider using \n","  - `\" + \".join()` to string together the terms from step 4.\n","  - an f-string with placeholders for $x$, $y$, etc. \n","\n","- It is possible to complete this code in 14 lines of code (excluding comments).

Pay attention to the `shuffle()` and `seed()` functions. Note that `seed()` works with strings as input. \n","- The random number generators used here are not actually random, of course. They just appear to be so when subjected to statistical analysis. In this case, that's by design since we need to be able to replicate a random number stream multiple times.\n","- The homegrown algorithm described below is similar to some real-life cyphers, including the [Enigma Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) used by Germany in World War II. Breaking the Enigma cypher system was one of the motivating problems for the earliest digital computers. Fortunately for the Allies, they happened to have [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) on their side. \n","- Caveat Emptor: The Mercene Twister algorithm used by the `random` library is not cryptographically secure. One can guess the seed (and thus everything thereafter) by analyzing a long enough sequence of generated random numbers. Also, passphrases are also inherently insecure, especially if they are short and use common phrases. \n","\n","### General Algorithm\n","\n","The encoding and decoding method, called a [Ceasar Cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), is based on a lookup with two character sets: \n","- `plain`, which lists the allowed characters in a preset order without duplication\n","- `cypher`, which is a shuffled version of the characters in the `plain` set  \n","\n","Thus, given a `cypher` character we can look up the `plain` character and vice versa. \n","\n","> **Heads Up**: The use of the term *set* here is not exactly accurate. Technically, sets don't have any implicit order. Instead, we are using the term to represent a *sequence* of characters without duplication. \n","\n","Here we will use the following string of 40 characters for our plain character set:\n","```\n","plainset = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ012345689 !,.'\n","```\n","\n","In the original Caesar Cypher, the `cypher` set was just a rotated (shifted) version of the `plain` set. Given a key number, say 10, we could create the `cypher` set by applying a function like Lesson 6's `char_rotate()` 10 times to the `plain` set. If there are 26 characters in the alphabet, then there are also 26 possible cyphers (including just plain text).\n","\n","In this challenge we will use `random.shuffle()` to generate a practically infinite number of possible cypher sets. To make it even more sneaky, we will reshuffle the cypher set after each plaintext character is encoded. \n","\n","We will need to decrypt the cyphertext one character at a time. The decoding itself is easy given the correct `plain` and `cypher` sets; it's a basic lookup. However, since the `cypher` set changes after decoding each character, we need to recreate the shuffling process exactly as it was when encoding. \n","\n","The key (eh, that's a pun) is knowing the passphrase, which acts sort of like the key number in the original caesar cypher. A pseudo-random number generator uses a _seed_ (i.e., the passphrase) to be used as a starting point for the stream of pseudo-random numbers that follows. If we know the seed then we can regenerate a given pseudo-random number stream as many times as we like. \n","\n","**With all of that said, the algorithm works like this:**\n","- Initialize the plain and cypher sets. You will need to set the random seed and then shuffle the `cypher` set before decrypting the cyphertext.\n","- Accumulate the plaintext starting from a blank string.\n","- For each character of cyphertext:\n","  - look up the corresponding plaintext character and append it to the plaintext string\n","  - shuffle the cypher set\n","\n","### Example Test Cases\n","- `random_shuffle_decrypt(\"CTIMI.89W\",\"DATA 5405\")` returns `'GO STAGS!'`\n","- `random_shuffle_decrypt(\"JENCT2Z50EAN.KTXCQFUMCKR,DYSD\",\"DATA 5405\")` returns `'PYTHON IS THE BEST THING EVER'`\n","\n","### Scoring Rubric\n","- **Correct (16 points):** Implements the algorithm correctly\n","- **Literate (4 points):** Well documented with meaningful Markdown and properly aligned code comments\n","- **Extra Credit (1 point):** Decrypts the cyphertext `'IDRQFY9S6GMXH98PIL5X0NCZP,BYYRG'` without being given the passphrase (guessing is allowed)"]}]}
