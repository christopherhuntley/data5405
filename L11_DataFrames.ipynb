We will only consider one of the more commonly used ones. To learn about the others, [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) the pandas I/O docs. We all do it, just about every time we have to import or export something in pandas. \n","> ![pandas io](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN5405-lessons/raw/master/img/L11_pandas_io.png)\n","\n","#### **Reading CSV Files with `read_csv()`**\n","The most common way to import data into pandas is with `read_csv()`, a function that reads tables in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format. It comes with a long list of parameters that we can pass as configuration arguments. The only required one is the first, `filepath`.\n","- `filepath` is a local file system path, url, or a text stream. It tells the function where to find the data. In the remaining parameter descriptions we will assume that we are reading from a file, but the meaning is the same for the other sources. \n","- `delimiter` sets the character used to separate columns. The default is a comma but we can use `\\tab` or any other single character we choose. If we don't want to choose we can leave it with the default or set the `delim_whitespace` argument to True.\n","- `header` indicates what line (row) of the file to look for column names (headers). The default is to look on the first line of the file.\n","- `names` allows us to override whatever column names are provided in file. \n","- `index_col` sets the column to use for the DataFrame index. We can supply either the column name (string) or its position (int). The default is `None`, which tells pandas to inidex it for us with 0, 1, 2, etc.\n","- `use_cols` allows us to skip some columns we don't want by supplying a `list` of the ones we do want. As with `index_col` we can use names or positions.\n","- `dtype` sets the data type for a column by name by passing a dictionary of data types. We can also tell it to use the same data type for all columns.\n","- `parse_dates` indicates which columns (including the index) to treat as `datetime` values. \n","\n","And many, many more.

My major was System Engineering, which when I started was a pretty soft program for engineering school orphans  but had developed into something special by the time I finally finished my PhD studies in 1995. I can honestly say that my life would have been so much worse if I had not lucked into it by picking the only open door I could find when I needed to choose a major. In my SE  classes I learned about systems analysis (\"big picture engineering\") from true experts, including the guy who coined the phrase \"information system\" and another who worked with John von Neumann on the very first digital computers. In grad school I was graced to work in a lab at the Institute for Parallel Computation, where I got to play around with lots of prototype supercomputer hardware and take all-expenses-paid trips to conferences around the country. And, of course, I met my future spouse doing homework in my third year. \n",">\n","> This tee is from my last couple years at UVa.
