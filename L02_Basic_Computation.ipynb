    "> \"What is essential is invisible to the eye.\" -- _The Little Prince_\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts in this lesson actually go all the way back to ancient times, when philosophers studied how they thought about ... thought. Plato, for example, spent significant time on the idea of [essentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism): the idea that **every entity (physical or conceptual) has an essential form** that defines its substance. That form has **features** consisting of facts that distinguish it from other entities. Entities also have **functions** that they carry out in the world. These essential forms and functions together define **types** or **categories** that are considered eternal, at which point philosophy starts to become theology ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we still use this basic framework to model the world around us, though with slightly different terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data** refers to facts. Each fact has a **value** that captures substance but not importance or meaning. The number 42 can mean lots of things to different people. If you are a Monty Python fan then perhaps you remember it from _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. If you are a baseball fan then 42 could be associated with Mariano Rivera or Jackie Robinson. Or it could just be the answer to \"What's 6 times 9?\" ... ([but only in base 13](https://spooniom.com/6-9-42/)). \n",
    "- **Information** refers to facts that have formal **meaning** and **structure**. When associating facts to entities, the facts are given names, kind of like attaching sticky labels, so we know how each fact relates to the entity. For example we can say that 42 is the _uniform number_ (feature) of _Jackie Robinson_ (entity), the famous _baseball player_ (essential type). Data itself can also have a type, just like entities do. Is it 42 or \"42\" or 42.0? It matters a lot, at least to a data scientist. However, it's hard to tell without knowing how it is to be interpreted. \n",
    "- **Knowledge** refers to functionality: the ability to use information to do things. A knowledgeable person can do a lot of things, once they have the necessary information. A less knowledgeable person might not be able to do anything useful, even when given perfect information. In Python, **the programs that we write are knowledge.** They are how we get the computer to do what we want it to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, each of these things builds on the ones before it. We could of course continue on to **wisdom** (knowing what to do at a given time) and **virtue** (knowing right vs wrong), but then we'd be getting into theology again instead of science."

    "- If it is a rational number then it may be the result of 420/10. \n",

    "### **Variable Naming**\n",
    "\n",
    ">There are only two hard problems in Computer Science: naming things and cache invalidation. --Phil Karlton\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use variables we have to give them names. A few basic principles apply, regardless of the language:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Each name has to be unique** in the context they are being used. We can't, for example, have the same name for two different entities. We can label two different entities with the same name, but never at the same time. Variable assignment only allows one value at a time. \n",
    "- **Names should be descriptive** enough that we, the programmers, know what each one stands for. Otherwise we can't follow each other's code without a road map, and who's got time for that? Even if we are the only ones to ever see the code, once a program gets larger than a couple dozen lines or so, it can get hard to remember everything. You want it to fit nicely in your head. \n",
    "- **Names should also be short** enough that fat fingered typists can use them without lots of typos. \n",
    "\n",
    "The official [Python Language Definition](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html) includes [some other rules](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers):\n",
    "- names can include letters, numbers, and underscores\n",
    "- names cannot start with a number\n",
    "- names can be any length, but anything over 79 characters may not work in older versions of Python\n",
    "- names must include at least one letter or an underscore (note: `_` by itself is a special variable in Jupyter)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some examples of bad variable names in Python:\n",
    "- `x`, `c`, `fizz`, `buzz`, `name` are not very descriptive. Only use these for sections of code where the meanings can easily be deduced by context or convention.\n",
    "- `this_is_the_theme_for_garrys_show` is certainly descriptive if it refers to the theme some from the _Garry Shandling Show_ but it may also be a bit long and too specific. What if Garry had chosen to rename his theme song? All our code would be trashed. \n",
    "- `in`, `for`,`def`, etc. are keywords. They are already taken.\n",
    "- `My Drive` has spaces in it. Python can't tell that `My` and `Drive` are part of the same name. **Use underscores (`_`) between words** instead. \n",
    "- `My_Drive` is also improper. In Python **variables should be lower case letters only.** Python will accept capital letters, but other programmers will complain. It's just not done. \n",
    "- `dollar$` is a bad name because it includes an illegal character. Leave that stuff for other languages. Python wants it clean. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this section is about variable names, **many of these same rules also apply to just everything else**:\n",
    "- Functions\n",
    "- Files\n",
    "- Data types\n",
    "- Libraries and modules\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple notable exceptions, though:\n",
    "- CONSTANTS (i.e., variables that don't actually vary) are often in `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`\n",
    "- Third-party data types (a.k.a., `classes`) should use `CamelCaseNaming` with the first letter of each word capitalized and no underscores. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are nonstandard because they are _intended_ to stand out. That they don't follow the rules clues us in that they have special meanings and uses.    \n",
    "\n",
    "For more about Python naming conventions, take a peek at the official [Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions), also known as PEP-8.\n",

    "## **Lexical Structure: Statements, Expressions, Operators, Literals, and Punctuation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you can learn a lot from just one line of code. For example, let's revisit a line from the section on variable assignment:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person1 = first_name + \" \" + last_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this one line we see a **statement**, an **operator**, and **an expression**. (Actually, there are three expressions, two operators, and a text literal but who's counting?)\n",
    "- the entire line of code `person1 = first_name + \" \" + last_name` is an assignment **statement**\n",
    "- the addition **operator** is denoted by the plus sign `+`\n",
    "- the calculation `first_name + \" \" + last_name` is an **expression**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A statement is the Python equivalent of an imperative sentence. Statements _do_ things that change the state (value) of other things.** A statement is one semantically complete thought (for the programmer) or one syntactically complete unit of code for Python to execute. Each time we ask the computer to do something, we give it a statement. If we give the computer a sequence of statements then it executes them one at a time in the order they are given. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as sentences in human language have syntactic structure (parts of speech), so do Python statements. In fact the precise grammar for all legal Python statements is defined in one surprisingly short document, [Python Language Definition](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html). The grammar rules defined there break each sentence down into variables, operations, keywords, literals, and punctuation. Everything is covered in fine detail. Consider, for example, how Python defines integer numbers:   \n",
    "![Integer Grammar Rule](../img/L2_1_Integer_Grammar.png)  \n",
    "While the notation (called BNF grammar, first used to design Fortran) is pretty arcane, just know that these 10 grammar rules (one per line) together describe every possible integer in every possible format recognized by Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only seen a few kinds of statements. The examples so far have been mostly assignment statements, which _always_ follow the same pattern: _`variable = expression`_. As we learned before, the _`expression`_ on the right is always evaluated first and then assigned to the _`variable`_ on the left. \n",
    "\n",
    "**An expression is anything that can be evaluated to produce a value. Expressions _are_ things.** So, each calculation like `1+1` or `first_name + \" \" + last_name` is an expression, but so is recalling the value of a variable like `first_name` or `last_name`. They each produce a value when evaluated. Expressions can be composed of other expressions. In order to evaluate them Python will break them down into smaller and smaller expressions, until all that's left is some combination of variables, operators, and **literal** values. **Literals** are things like numbers or text strings that don't need to be broken down any further. \n",
    "\n",
    "**An operator represents a calculation with a symbol like `+` or `%`.** In order for operators to be useful they have to be applied to one or more **operands** according to a specific pattern. So, for example, the `+` operator follows this pattern: _`expression1 + expression2`_, where the operands are `expression1` and `expression2`.  In principle, an operator can have any number of operands: unary operators have one operand, binary operators have two, ternary operators have three, etc. However, all of Python's built-in operators are binary, with one operand on the left and another on the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we apply an operator to a set of operands we call it an **operation**. Since operations always produce a value, they are also expressions and can also be broken down into smaller and smaller parts. When doing so we need to know which operations to evaluate first. For that we can use the same [PEMDAS rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) you likely learned in middle school. Operations are evaluated **left to right** _except_ ...\n",
    "- operations inside **parentheses** (or other grouping operation) must be evaluated before ...\n",
    "- **exponents** and roots, which must be evaluated before ...\n",
    "- **multiplication** and **division**, which must be evaluated before ...\n",
    "- **addition** and **subtraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, `3*6+1/2` evaluates to 18.5 while `3*(6+1)/2` evaluates to 10.5. If in doubt about how an expression is going to be evaluated, use parentheses to force it to go the way you want it to go. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Punctuation is everything else we need to structure our statements.** We haven't seen much of that yet but we will. Besides **white space** (which we learned about in lesson 1) we will also use dots `.`, colons `:`, parentheses `()`, brackets `[]` and other symbols as hints to help Python break statements down into their various parts.  \n",

    "> ABOUT GOOGLE CLASSROOM AND PRICELINE    \n",
    "> In 2014 I was approached by an alum to round up students to test a new app called Google Classroom, which was in private beta (with an NDA). I said I would be glad to get some of my classes to try it out _very quietly_ if the development team paid us a visit at the end of the semester. They came, asked and answered lots of questions, and left me with a monster box of these tee shirts in black and green. I gave away what I could but kept this one black tee as a souvenir. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">This was not the first time we had a top secret beta test at Fairfield. In my first year I was approached by an alum about this new service being developed at Walker Digital. It was, of course, Priceline. Fairfield students were used as focus groups, including the one that picked William Shatner as the spokeperson. It was entirely based on his voice (for radio ads). Shatner beat out Hellen Mirren and a couple others with distinctive voices. After that we also got juicy details from the first couple years of website development. Lots of things broke back then -- it wasn't until version 3 that they could actually issue electronic tickets without having to print and snail mail them to you -- and I am always a sucker for a good war story. \n",
