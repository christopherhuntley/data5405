    "As we said when discussing key hashing in the last lesson, there are good reasons why one might want immutable types like strings or numbers. But, why would we want a data type for immutable sequences? We can't add new values. We can't change values. We can't delete them. All we can do is create a tuple literal and then use it ... somehow. Is this really better than a list? No, it's not. It's just different. \n",

A close second, however, was my time as NCAA Faculty Athletics Representative in 2011-2017. The student-athletes showed me what hard work looked like! There were whole teams that both won their conference championships and held an average GPA above 3.6, sometimes for several years in a row. Amazing!\n",

I now have a closet full of red dress shirts and I try to remember to wear one of them every Friday during the school year.  \n",
