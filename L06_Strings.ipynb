The modern world is by design, not accident, or so we like to believe. \n","\n","In the very beginning, all data and programs were **encoded** as **binary**: strings of zeroes and ones called **bits** where every few bits represented something else. We still use binary (at least in digital computers), of course, but not many people speak it natively anymore. It's just too computer-specific and hard for us humans to process. Instead, we use an ever evolving repertoire of **languages** and **data structures** to express ourselves and keep our data safe and useful. \n","\n","After the **bit** the next standard data type was the **byte**, composed of 8 bits with 256 possible values, which is just enough to encode each key on a computer keyboard. Thus, [**ASCII**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) was born. ASCII used seven of the bits (i.e., 128 possible values) for the keyboard codes, with the last bit available for error checking. Each character was assigned a number (e.g., \"A\" = binary `1000001` = decimal 65). Upper case letters were separate from lower case letters (\"a\" = `1100001` = 97) and every \"control\" character (e.g. tab, line ending, end of file, etc.) has an ASCII encoding as well. \n","\n","When strung together, **bytes** could represent lots of things as **strings**, **integers**, and **floats**, which you will recognize as native Python data types. From there it was natural to think of more elaborate data structures like complex numbers or lists. These in turn led to decimal and fractional numbers, and file, array, list, tuple, and dictionary collections. Today the Python standard library includes dozens of data types, each with its own unique properties and uses. And, if none of these quite do what we want, we can always create our own. \n","\n","This lesson starts our explorations into the world of data structures with a review of the **string data type**, which in practice is the most commonly used data structure of all. While we analytics geeks would likely prefer to have quantitative data all the time, if a human is involved in its collection or communication then it almost certainly will start as text strings.

It marked when I started to think a little differently about the world around me. I had just finished my masters studies in an area now called evolutionary computation (i.e., solving math problems with simulated sexual reproduction) but then simply called Genetic Algorithms. At the conference I got a prime speaking spot, with several kinda famous names in the audience and my overhead slides projected 15 feet tall behind me. I was going all out. I'd even paid to get the slides printed in color! Up on stage I felt like [Patton](https://www.hollywood.com/general/patton-movie-stills-57256250/#/ms-1915/1) lecturing to the troops. \n",">\n",">I got about halfway through my slides, just about the point where I was about to quote John Holland, the founder of the field, when I spotted him sitting in the first row, watching intently. I didn't expect that. I froze for about 20 seconds, or at least that's what it felt like; I have no idea. I guess he figured out what happened because he motioned for me to continue with my quote. Afterwards he bought me lunch. He turned out to be a very nice and patient man, a true educator as well as a world famous scientist.\n",">\n","> That night, as I sat in the lobby watching TV with the other geeks from around the world, I was again frozen, this time with what we were seeing live. It was the [Tank Man video](https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/behind-the-scenes-tank-man-of-tiananmen/) from the Tiananmen Square massacre. I could not believe what I was seeing. Could that be real? I was told by several people who seemed to know that yes, that's how it happens there. Could it happen here, I wondered? It already has of course but that's another story. \n",">\n","> The conference tee shirt -- we all wore it in the group photo -- features binary code evolving into the words \"Genetic Algorithms.\" It's held up pretty well for being over 30 years old.        \n","\n","![L6 Tee Front](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN5405-docs/raw/master/Photos/L06_TeeFront.jpeg)\n","\n","## Copyright &copy; 2020 Christopher Huntley.
