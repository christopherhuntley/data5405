Note: later requirements depend on earlier requirements, so you should check your work as you go along._\n","\n","Since this is an ungraded assignment, you are encouraged to work with whoever you like. However, to get the intended benefits, don't just copy the work of your peers. Make sure you know _why_ each answer is correct. If given a different set of tasks could you do them without help? \n","\n","---\n","## Instructions\n","Please structure your work as a report below this cell. Try to be as polished and professional as you can be, using Markdown and code comments wherever they can make the report easier for others to read and understand.   \n","\n","1. **Analyze the Source Data.**   \n","Open the [AAPL_MSFT_IBM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN5405-lessons/master/AAPL_MSFT_IBM.csv) file in GitHub. Study the data for structure and purpose. What is the purpose of the first row? What do the columns represent? What data type is each column?\n","Include a markdown cell with your comments.\n","\n","2. **Load the source data.**    \n","Use the pandas `read_csv()` function to load the the `AAPL_MSFT_IBM.csv` dataset from GitHub as follows:    \n","    \n","  - Three DataFrames named `aapl`, `msft`, and `ibm`.\n","  - Each dataframe should have the following columns: `date`,`high`,`low`,`close`,`volume`\n","  - Use the dates as the index.\n","  - Date strings should be parsed as pandas datetime objects.\n","  - Do not alter the data file. You must read it as given.\n","\n","3. **Plot the closing prices over time.**    \n","  - For full credit, plot each separately using the plot() method.   \n","  - For _another 5 points extra credit_, plot all three tickers on the same plot.\n","  - Label the y axis as `Price per Share`.\n","  - Display a legend that labels each series with its ticker symbol.\n","\n","4. **Add a \"fluctuation\" column to `aapl`, `msft`, and `ibm`.**   \n","  Daily fluctuation percentage is 100*(high-low)/close.\n","\n","5. **Plot the fluctations over time for each stock.**.   \n","Use the same technique as you used in requirement 3. \n","\n","6. **Use `idxmax` to determine the date of the largest fluctuation in `aapl` price.**     \n","  - How big was the fluctuation that day?\n","  - What was so special about that particular day? \n","  - Be sure to clearly answer both questions\n","\n","7. **Calculate the correlation between \"fluctuation\" and \"volume\" for `aapl`. Then display a scatter plot.**\n","  - Does there appear to be a correlation? \n","  - Again, include your analysis in the report. \n","\n","8. **Document everything like a pro with appropriate markdown and code comments.** \n","  - **Comments** should explain exactly what each line of code does, If calling functions or methods, indicate why did you set any named arguments.  If setting a variable then say what purpose the variable serves, etc. Every decision you made should be documented.\n","  - **Markdown** is used to structure your document so it can be read and understood by other humans. Use section headings, not just bolded text. Use bullet points, not big blocks of text. Frame your analysis so that we get exactly what you concluded _and why_.  \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5MTcMi_hFi14"},"source":["# **YOUR WORK GOES HERE.** "]}]}
