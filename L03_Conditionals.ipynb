And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.” -- Edsger Dijkstra\n","\n","Back in the computer science dinosaur times when everybody wore white coats there were lesser dinosaurs and then there were giants that made the earth shake as they went about their daily business. Computer scientists like Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Grace Hopper, Doug Englebart, Alan Kay, Donald Knuth, Leonard Kleinrock, Seymour Cray, and CJ Date were often thinking decades ahead of anybody else. Consider, for example, the _Mother of All Demos_ (read about on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos), watch on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ8ZiT1sn88)), in which Doug Englebart demonstrated a graphical user interface (with windows, a mouse, and hyperlinks), video conferencing over what would later be called the Internet, Google Doc-style collaborative word processing, and Git-like revision control _**in 1968**_. They may been dinosaurs but they certainly weren't dumb.\n","\n","About the same time as Englebart's earthquake of a demo, Edsger Dijkstra developed (and proved!) the theory of Structured Programming that underlies **every** general purpose programming language, then and now. Structured programming is about programming logic, of which there are 4 fundamental elements:\n","\n","- **blocks** of statements to be executed one after another\n","- **conditionals** that select one block of statements over others (based on selection criteria)\n","- **loops** that repeat a block of statements some number of times (subject to stopping criterion)\n","- **subroutines** that allow us to parameterize (template) and reuse (call) logical blocks whenever we need it\n","\n","In Lesson 2 we learned how to use blocks. In this lesson we will cover conditionals before moving on to functions (subroutines) in Lesson 4 and iteration (loops) in Lesson 5.

Hmmm. Let's unpack it to look at the various forms it might take.\n","\n","### **The `if` Form**\n","In theory all we need is some way to check a boolean expression before running some code. If the boolean evaluates to `True` then run the code. Otherwise, just don't. \n","\n","`if` statements always follow the same pattern:\n","```python\n","if boolean_expression:\n","    block\n","```\n","where \n","- `boolean_expression` is a boolean expression\n","- `block` is sequence of one or more statements (which Python calls a \"suite\")\n","- the `if`, colon `:`, and indentation (leading tabs/spaces) are required for Python to recognize this as an `if` statement\n","\n","For example, this conditional statement prints out the value of `1/x` but only if x is not zero:\n","\n","```python\n","if x != 0:\n","   print(1/x)\n","```\n","\n","> **Heads up:** Jupyter is pretty smart about indentation. It will automatically increase the indent for the line immediately after the `if ... :`. It will continue to indent the same way on each subsequent line until you use a backspace (or delete) to move the cursor to the left. \n","\n","### **The `if` ... `else` Form**\n","Sometimes we want to specify an alternate \"catch all\" logic block for when the `boolean_expression` is false:\n","\n","```python\n","if boolean_expression:\n","    success_block\n","else:\n","    failure_block\n","```\n","Note that indentation and a colon are again being used to separate one clause of our statement from the next. All statements inside the `success_block` and `failure_block` have to be indented to the same degree so that they line up exactly. If any of these statements themselves require indentation then they add indentation to whatever was needed to define the block. We'll see how that works when we get to **nested conditionals**. \n","\n","Continuing our `1/x` example, we might want to handle the `x == 0` case:\n","```python\n","if x != 0:\n","   print(1/x)\n","else: \n","   print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n","```\n","\n","### **The `if` ... `elif` ... `else` Form**\n","There are times when we want to consider three or more possible conditions. For that we use one or more `elif` clauses.\n","\n","```python\n","if boolean1:\n","    block1\n","elif boolean2:\n","    block2\n","else:\n","    block_else\n","``` \n","We can have as many `elif` clauses as we like. We can even leave off the `else`:\n","\n","```python\n","if boolean1:\n","    block1\n","elif boolean2:\n","    block2\n","```\n","\n","Take note that the form without the `else` is subtly different. With `if ... elif ... else` there are three possible outcomes:\n","- `block1` executes\n","- `block2` executes\n","- `block_else` executes\n","\n","When we omit the `else` clause there are **also** three possibilities: \n","- `block1` executes\n","- `block2` executes\n","- **nothing** executes\n","\n","Once again, this is subtle but it can cause unexpected bugs. One solution is to _always_ have an `else` clause if there is an `elif`. But what if we don't actually want a catch all block? For that we can use the `pass` keyword to indicate, you guessed it, _do nothing_. \n","\n","```python\n","if boolean1:\n","    block1\n","elif boolean2:\n","    block2\n","else:\n","    pass\n","```\n","That at least makes the logic explicit so we aren't haunted by bugs in an `else` clause that isn't there. \n","\n","#### **Note about short-circuited conditionals**\n","Regardless of the form used, `if` statements work a lot like boolean expressions. Python only executes clauses until it finds one to execute. It then ignores the rest. So, if `boolean1` is `True` then Python doesn't care to evaluate `boolean2`, etc.; it just runs `block1` and goes about its business. We'll make use of this later, so be prepared to come back here again. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6EerIamePokO"},"source":["### **Nested Conditionals**\n","Since every conditional statement has one or more blocks, which themselves contain more statements, we can **nest** an `if` statement inside another one like this:\n","\n","```python\n","if type(x) == int or type(x) == float:\n","    if x != 0:\n","       print(1/x)\n","    else: \n","       print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"x must be a number\")\n","```\n","\n","The inner `if` statement is indented like any other statement in the block, moving over to the right of the outer `if` statement. \n","\n","Some people find nested conditionals confusing.

For that we use a conditional expression: \n","\n","```python\n","expression_success if condition else expression_failure\n","```\n","\n","Conditional expressions are not statements. They just allow calculations to vary one way or another. \n","\n","With conditional expressions, we can directly assign the value just like we did with boolean assignment earlier in the lesson:\n","```python\n","x = \"y >= 0\" if y >= 0 else \"y < 0\"\n","```\n","\n","It's shorter and makes certain one-line codes possible that would be a pain to do any other way. Conditional expressions are even nestable, making it possible to handle more than two outcomes (like an `elif`). \n","\n","### **Defensive Programming**\n","\n","Defensive programming is an approach to programming that was originally intended to avoid security bugs and system crashes. The idea is to detect and mitigate all of the things that could make a bit of code fail (crash or produce an incorrect outcome). \n","\n","The general pattern is something like this:\n","```python\n","if conditions_that_might_cause_a_failure:\n","    fail_gracefully\n","else:\n","    execute_normally\n","```\n","\n","It seems like common sense, right? Nonetheless, most people still don't bother to put in safeguards. For example, let's say that we want to print out a warning if the ratio `y/x` is greater than 1. The naive way is like this:\n","\n","```python\n","if (y/x > 1):\n","    print(\"Warning! y/x > 1\")\n","```\n","It's pretty straightforward but also wrong. We didn't consider the possibility that `x` might be 0 and cause the ratio `y/x` to become undefined. Bingo, that's a potential runtime error and a system crash. Oops. \n","\n","We will learn a few ways to \"bulletproof\" code like this in the next few lessons, starting with **guards** and **exception handling**.\n","    \n","#### **Boolean Guards**\n","One of the most \"dangerous\" times for your code are inside conditionals like `y/x > 1`. We are so often focused on the \"normal\" case that we forget about the exceptions. \n","\n","A **guard** is a quick and easy way to short-circuit a boolean expression with an `and` operation. In the ratio example the following would have done the trick:\n","```python\n","if x !=0 and y/x > 1:\n","    print(\"Warning! y/x > 1\")\n","```\n","By inserting the `x != 0` check before the ratio check `y/x > 1` the conditional will short-circuit if `x` is 0. This avoids the possibility of a \"divide by zero\" runtime error entirely.\n","\n","#### **Handling Exceptions**\n","Another way to deal with potential runtime errors is with a `try ... except` handler:\n","\n","```python\n","try:\n","    some_potentially_buggy_code\n","except:\n","    what_to_do_if_a_runtime_error_occurs\n","```\n","\n","In this case we don't even bother to predict what could go wrong. Instead, we ask Python to let us know if a runtime error happens so we can mitigate the damage (and hopefully forestall a crash or something even worse). \n","\n","You may be wondering: **why do we even bother with guards if we can just handle exceptions this way?** Because `try ... except` does not guarantee that the damage _can_ be mitigated after a runtime error. So to be sure, it's best to use guards to prevent what you can and then `try ... except` for everything else.
